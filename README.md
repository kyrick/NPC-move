# NPC Move

Basic implementation of NPC movement in a overhead 2D zelda like. 

NPC has two modes of movement selectable in editor: 
* Random Movement with configurable x,y ranges
* Mouse follow movement

There is no pathfinding. The NPC will try to find the shortest path and slide around any objets in it's way if it can.
